I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the [School of EECS, Oregon State University](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/), Corvallis, Oregon. 

Currently, I am working at the Wallace Energy Systems & Renewables Facility under the supervision of Dr. Ted Brekken. My research work is focused on the control and modeling of power electronics components with an emphasis on renewable energy technologies.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

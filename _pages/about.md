I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the [School of EECS, Oregon State University](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/), Corvallis, Oregon. 

Currently, I am working at the [Wallace Energy Systems & Renewables Facility](https://wesrf.engr.oregonstate.edu/) under the supervision of Dr. Ted Brekken. My research work is focused on the control and modeling of power electronics components with an emphasis on renewable energy technologies.

I receieved an MS in Mechanical Engineering from Kumoh National Institute of Technology, Gumi, South Korea in 2020 and a BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering from East West University, Dhaka, Bangladesh in 2016.

Besides doing research I like to play cricket, ride bicycle, and make a long road trip.

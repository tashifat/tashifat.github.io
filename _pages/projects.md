AI Based Prognostics and Health Management of BLDC Motors 
==========================================================

Prognostics and health management (PHM) has become a fundamental element of engineering systems for ensuring improved system reliability and productivity. With increasing demand, machines are functioning in more complex environment with intricate operating conditions. A failure in a machine can cause an unexpected shutdown of the entire system, reduction in output, loss of human and environmental resources. Therefore, health monitoring of a system is a foremost necessity to avoid catastrophic failures and maximize the output. In this study, we investigate several electrical and mechanical faults of permanent magnet brushless DC (BLDC) motor by monitoring multiple sensor data collected from different experiments. Degradation pattern of motor health was continuously monitored by analyzing several sensor data such as-vibration, temperature, current and voltage data.
